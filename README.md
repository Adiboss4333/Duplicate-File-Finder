# Duplicate File Finder

## Introduction
This is a simple command-line tool developed in Python for finding duplicate files within a specified directory. It offers basic functionality to help users manage duplicate files effectively.

## How It Works
1. Enter the directory path you want to scan for duplicate files.
2. Choose one of the following options:
   - Option 1: Keep one copy of each duplicate file and delete the rest.
   - Option 2: Delete all duplicate files.
   - Option 3: Exit the program.

## Example
Suppose you want to find duplicate files in the directory "my_folder". After running the script, you would:
1. Enter "my_folder" as the directory path.
2. Choose an option (1, 2, or 3) based on how you want to handle duplicate files.
